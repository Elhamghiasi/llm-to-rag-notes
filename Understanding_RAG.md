# RAG vs. Fine-Tuning

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Fine-Tuning** are two methods enterprises can use to get more value out of Large Language Models (LLMs). Both approaches aim to tailor the LLM to specific use cases, but they differ significantly in methodology.

- **Fine-Tuning**: Involves training the LLM on a domain-specific dataset so that the model parameters are updated to reflect the new knowledge. This creates a customized version of the base model that can generate more relevant outputs for the target use case.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Instead of changing the model itself, RAG combines the LLM with an external knowledge base. When a query is made, the system retrieves relevant documents from the external source and feeds them into the model, enabling it to generate responses based on up-to-date and domain-specific information.

Each method has its advantages:
- Fine-tuning is powerful for deeply embedding domain expertise.
- RAG is ideal for dynamic content and requires less computational cost and risk of model drift.

Choosing between the two depends on the specific goals, data availability, and infrastructure of the enterprise.




## What’s the Difference Between RAG and Fine-Tuning?

The difference between **RAG** and **fine-tuning** is that RAG augments a natural language processing (NLP) model by connecting it to an organization’s proprietary database, while fine-tuning optimizes deep learning models for domain-specific tasks.

RAG and fine-tuning have the same intended outcome: enhancing a model’s performance to maximize value for the enterprise that uses it.

- **RAG** uses an organization’s internal data to augment prompt engineering.
- **Fine-tuning** retrains a model on a focused set of external data to improve performance.
