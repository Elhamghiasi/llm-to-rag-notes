# Integrating Knowledge Graphs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## 1. How Knowledge Graphs Relate to RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) typically pulls **unstructured text** from document stores. In contrast, **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)** organize information as structured, relational data. This creates new opportunities:

- Instead of retrieving raw text, RAG could retrieve **structured facts** from a KG.
- KG **entities and relationships** can help disambiguate queries and improve retrieval quality.
- A **hybrid KG-enhanced RAG system** can combine structured facts with generative reasoning.

## 2. Research Ideas at the Intersection of RAG and KGs

###  Knowledge-Aware Retrieval in RAG
- Can we retrieve **structured triples (entity‚Äìrelation‚Äìentity)** instead of raw documents?
- Can KGs help **filter irrelevant or contradictory information** during retrieval?

###  KG-Guided Context Expansion
- Instead of just documents, retrieve a **subgraph** to add relevant background knowledge.
- *Example:* For a query like ‚ÄúEinstein‚Äôs contribution to quantum physics,‚Äù fetch subgraph nodes like:  
  `Einstein ‚Üí Quantum Mechanics ‚Üí Key Papers`.

###  RAG for KG Completion
- Use RAG-generated answers to **fill missing links** in an incomplete KG.
- *Example:* Predict missing disease‚Äìsymptom links in a health KG.

###  Fact Verification using KGs
- Use KGs to **verify if retrieved/generated claims are true**.
- *Example:* Confirming that ‚ÄúTesla‚Äôs first invention‚Äù matches facts in a KG.

###  Multimodal RAG with KGs
- Retrieve **images, tables, or graphs** from KGs.
- *Example:* For science queries, retrieve chemical structures or citation networks from a KG.

## 4. Example Comparisons

###  Example 1: Movie Question

**Question:** "Who directed *Inception*?"

#### RAG Approach:
- Retrieves Wikipedia/IMDB pages.
- Generates: ‚ÄúInception was directed by Christopher Nolan.‚Äù
-  May hallucinate if documents are wrong or outdated.

#### KG Approach:
- Directly queries: `(Inception) ‚Üí (directed by) ‚Üí (Christopher Nolan)`
-  Returns an exact, high-confidence answer.

| Feature           | RAG                              | Knowledge Graph                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Data Type        | Unstructured text                 | Structured triples                |
| Output           | Generated text (may hallucinate)  | Exact facts (high precision)      |
| Flexibility      | Can handle vague queries          | Needs structured queries          |
| Scalability      | Scales with large text corpora    | Needs curated data                |

###  Example 2: Medical Question

**Question:** "What are the symptoms of diabetes?"

#### RAG Approach:
- Retrieves articles or blog posts.
- Generates: ‚ÄúIncreased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue...‚Äù
-  May include outdated/misleading info.

#### KG Approach:
- Queries structured facts like:
  - `(Diabetes) ‚Üí (has symptom) ‚Üí (Increased thirst)`
  - `(Diabetes) ‚Üí (has symptom) ‚Üí (Frequent urination)`
-  Returns a complete and trusted list.

| Feature              | RAG                                 | Knowledge Graph                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Misinformation Risk | May retrieve unreliable sources      | Uses curated, verified data       |
| Query Handling      | Good at summaries and explanations   | Limited to stored facts           |
| Updating Data       | Easy via new documents               | Requires manual KG updates        |

###  Example 3: Shopping Assistant

**Question:** "Which smartphones have the best camera in 2024?"

#### RAG Approach:
- Summarizes reviews: ‚ÄúiPhone 15 Pro and Galaxy S24 Ultra.‚Äù
-  May rely on subjective or outdated reviews.

#### KG Approach:
- Queries product ratings:
  - `(iPhone 15 Pro) ‚Üí (camera rating) ‚Üí (9.5/10)`
  - `(Galaxy S24 Ultra) ‚Üí (camera rating) ‚Üí (9.6/10)`
-  Provides ranked, objective facts.

| Feature         | RAG                                | Knowledge Graph                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Subjectivity    | Can summarize opinions              | Returns objective facts           |
| Freshness       | Easily updates from new reviews     | Requires curated updates          |
| UX              | Conversational and fluent           | More database-like experience     |
