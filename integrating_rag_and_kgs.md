# Integrating Knowledge Graphs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## 1. How Knowledge Graphs Relate to RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) typically pulls **unstructured text** from document stores. In contrast, **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)** organize information as structured, relational data. This creates new opportunities:

- Instead of retrieving raw text, RAG could retrieve **structured facts** from a KG.
- KG **entities and relationships** can help disambiguate queries and improve retrieval quality.
- A **hybrid KG-enhanced RAG system** can combine structured facts with generative reasoning.

## 3. Example Comparisons

###  Example 1: Movie Question

**Question:** "Who directed *Inception*?"

#### RAG Approach:
- Retrieves Wikipedia/IMDB pages.
- Generates: “Inception was directed by Christopher Nolan.”
-  May hallucinate if documents are wrong or outdated.

#### KG Approach:
- Directly queries: `(Inception) → (directed by) → (Christopher Nolan)`
-  Returns an exact, high-confidence answer.

| Feature           | RAG                              | Knowledge Graph                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Data Type        | Unstructured text                 | Structured triples                |
| Output           | Generated text (may hallucinate)  | Exact facts (high precision)      |
| Flexibility      | Can handle vague queries          | Needs structured queries          |
| Scalability      | Scales with large text corpora    | Needs curated data                |

###  Example 2: Medical Question

**Question:** "What are the symptoms of diabetes?"

#### RAG Approach:
- Retrieves articles or blog posts.
- Generates: “Increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue...”
-  May include outdated/misleading info.

#### KG Approach:
- Queries structured facts like:
  - `(Diabetes) → (has symptom) → (Increased thirst)`
  - `(Diabetes) → (has symptom) → (Frequent urination)`
-  Returns a complete and trusted list.

| Feature              | RAG                                 | Knowledge Graph                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Misinformation Risk | May retrieve unreliable sources      | Uses curated, verified data       |
| Query Handling      | Good at summaries and explanations   | Limited to stored facts           |
| Updating Data       | Easy via new documents               | Requires manual KG updates        |

###  Example 3: Shopping Assistant

**Question:** "Which smartphones have the best camera in 2024?"

#### RAG Approach:
- Summarizes reviews: “iPhone 15 Pro and Galaxy S24 Ultra.”
-  May rely on subjective or outdated reviews.

#### KG Approach:
- Queries product ratings:
  - `(iPhone 15 Pro) → (camera rating) → (9.5/10)`
  - `(Galaxy S24 Ultra) → (camera rating) → (9.6/10)`
-  Provides ranked, objective facts.

| Feature         | RAG                                | Knowledge Graph                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Subjectivity    | Can summarize opinions              | Returns objective facts           |
| Freshness       | Easily updates from new reviews     | Requires curated updates          |
| UX              | Conversational and fluent           | More database-like experience     |
