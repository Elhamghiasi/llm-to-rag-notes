# RAG vs. Fine-Tuning

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Fine-Tuning** are two methods enterprises can use to get more value out of Large Language Models (LLMs). Both approaches aim to tailor the LLM to specific use cases, but they differ significantly in methodology.

- **Fine-Tuning**: Involves training the LLM on a domain-specific dataset so that the model parameters are updated to reflect the new knowledge. This creates a customized version of the base model that can generate more relevant outputs for the target use case.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Instead of changing the model itself, RAG combines the LLM with an external knowledge base. When a query is made, the system retrieves relevant documents from the external source and feeds them into the model, enabling it to generate responses based on up-to-date and domain-specific information.

Each method has its advantages:
- Fine-tuning is powerful for deeply embedding domain expertise.
- RAG is ideal for dynamic content and requires less computational cost and risk of model drift.

Choosing between the two depends on the specific goals, data availability, and infrastructure of the enterprise.




## What’s the Difference Between RAG and Fine-Tuning?

The difference between **RAG** and **fine-tuning** is that RAG augments a natural language processing (NLP) model by connecting it to an organization’s proprietary database, while fine-tuning optimizes deep learning models for domain-specific tasks.

RAG and fine-tuning have the same intended outcome: enhancing a model’s performance to maximize value for the enterprise that uses it.

- **RAG** uses an organization’s internal data to augment prompt engineering.
- **Fine-tuning** retrains a model on a focused set of external data to improve performance.


## How Does RAG Work?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** works by locating information in internal data sources that is relevant to the user’s query, then using that data to generate more accurate responses. A data *"retrieval"* mechanism is added to *"augment"* the LLM by helping it *"generate"* more relevant responses.

RAG models generate answers via a four-stage process:

1. **Query**: A user submits a query, which initializes the RAG system.
2. **Information Retrieval**: Complex algorithms comb the organization’s knowledge bases in search of relevant information.
3. **Integration**: The retrieved data is combined with the user’s query and given to the RAG model to answer. Up to this point, the LLM has not processed the query.
4. **Response**: Blending the retrieved data with its own training and stored knowledge, the LLM generates a contextually accurate response.

When searching through internal documents, RAG systems use **semantic search**. Vector databases organize data by similarity, enabling searches by meaning rather than keyword. Semantic search allows RAG algorithms to understand the intent behind a query and return the most relevant data.

However, RAG systems require **extensive data architecture** construction and maintenance. Data engineers must build the pipelines needed to connect the organization’s data lakehouses with the LLM.
